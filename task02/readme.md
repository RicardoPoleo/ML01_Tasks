# Task 02
Migrate the code from task 01 to a jupyter notebook, add it to a GitHub repository and make PRs/CRs to the repo.

## Housekeeping
To keep the repo clean and organized, let's create a folder for each member to upload the codes.

If the task requires that we all work on the same file, we can skip this step.
