# Machine Learning 01
## Task 01
The task was to create a python script to scrape an article given the url of the article and store the extracted text 
in a file.

Upload the .py file and the scraped text file to the page on d2l.

## Task 02
We were asked to migrate the code to a jupyter notebook, add it to a GitHub repository and make PRs/CRs to the repo.

For to keep the repo clean and organized while also allowing to use this for future asignations, I created a folder for
each task and a README.md file for each task.

Also, added a .gitignore file to avoid uploading configuration files such as .idea and .vscode.
